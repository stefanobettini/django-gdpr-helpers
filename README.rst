GDPR Helpers
======

GDPR Helpers is a Django app for easy GDPR compliance.

Quickstart
-------

Install Django GDPR Helpers::
   pip install -e git+git@github.com:Arussil/django-gdpr-helpers.git

Add it to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

.. code-block:: python
   INSTALLED_APPS = (
      ...
      'gdpr_helpers',
      ...
   )

Define your reasons for asking personal data and assign them to a group:

.. code-block:: python

   from gdpr_helpers.models import LegalReasonGroup, LegalReason

   group = LegalReasonGroup.objects.create(where="registration")

   LegalReason.objects.create(group=group, flag_text="Required for registration", active=True, required=True)
   LegalReason.objects.create(group=group, flag_text="Optional for registration", active=True, required=False)

Or use the django-admin.

Add the Mixin to a form that create an object and need privacy flags:

.. code-block:: python
   from django import forms
   from gdpr_helpers.forms import GDPRFormMixin
   from .models import User


   class RegistrationForm(GDPRFormMixin):
      class Meta:
         model = User
         where = "registration"
         fields = ("whatever_fields_from_model",)

Note that the privacy fields are already injected in the form.

Filling the form will now create logs for the object created.

Features
--------

* Can define Legal reason for which you are collecting personal data
* Create logs for the data you collected with a timestamp and what the user consented to
* Logs are anonymous

TODO
----

* When the user/system/admin removes the object we must keep a reference, maybe an unique ID that binds the deleted record to the logs
* Adding a serializer to use it on rest_framework project
* Add the ability to define a timer for data based on Legal reason, so we can destroy it after it expires or ask the user for another consent
